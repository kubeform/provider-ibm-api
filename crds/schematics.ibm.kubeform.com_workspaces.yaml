                      the template in your source repo. If successfully connected,
                      the template is downloaded and metadata, such as input parameters,
                      is extracted. After the template is downloaded, the state of
                      the workspace changes to `Scanning`.  **Draft**: The workspace
                      is created without a reference to a GitHub or GitLab repository.  **Failed**:
                      If errors occur during the execution of your infrastructure
                      code in IBM Cloud Schematics, your workspace status is set to

                      If you have an `Active` workspace and decide to remove all your
                      resources, your workspace is set to `Inactive` after all your
                      resources are removed.  **In progress**: When you instruct IBM

                      your Terraform execution plan, the status of our workspace changes

                      the scan is successful, the workspace state changes to `Inactive`.
                      If errors in your template are found, the state changes to `Template

                      you successfully ran your infrastructure code by applying your
                      Terraform execution plan, the state of your workspace changes
                      to `Active`.  **Connecting**: Schematics tries to connect to
                      the template in your source repo. If successfully connected,
                      the template is downloaded and metadata, such as input parameters,
                      is extracted. After the template is downloaded, the state of
                      the workspace changes to `Scanning`.  **Draft**: The workspace
                      is created without a reference to a GitHub or GitLab repository.  **Failed**:
                      If errors occur during the execution of your infrastructure
                      code in IBM Cloud Schematics, your workspace status is set to
                      `Failed`.  **Inactive**: The Terraform template was scanned
                      successfully and the workspace creation is complete. You can
                      now start running Schematics plan and apply actions to provision
                      the IBM Cloud resources that you specified in your template.
                      If you have an `Active` workspace and decide to remove all your
                      resources, your workspace is set to `Inactive` after all your
                      resources are removed.  **In progress**: When you instruct IBM
                      Cloud Schematics to run your infrastructure code by applying
                      your Terraform execution plan, the status of our workspace changes
                      to `In progress`.  **Scanning**: The download of the Terraform
                      template is complete and vulnerability scanning started. If
                      the scan is successful, the workspace state changes to `Inactive`.
                      If errors in your template are found, the state changes to `Template
                      Error`.  **Stopped**: The Schematics plan, apply, or destroy
                      action was cancelled manually.  **Template Error**: The Schematics
